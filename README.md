## Hi everyone 👋

My name is David and I'm a software engineer who is always learning. 

I used to be a frontend developer with imposter syndrome so I went back to school (it's never too late!). I'm now working on my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech (part-time and online) so I've only managed to slide even further down the Dunning-Kruger curve!
